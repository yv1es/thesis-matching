    Solve the Linear Sum Assignment Problem (minimize the sum of ranks) using SciPy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    C : np.ndarray, shape (n, m)
        Cost matrix where C[i, j] is the rank (1â€¦K) that student i assigns to topic j,
        or np.inf if topic j is not in student i's preference list.

    Returns
    -------
    assignment : np.ndarray, shape (n,)
        For each student i, the index j of the assigned topic.
    total_cost : float
        The total sum of ranks over all students.
